# Male_baldness_type_detection
This project classifies male baldness stages 3 to 7 using YOLOv8 and Sequential CNN models, based on the Hamilton-Norwood scale. Due to limited data, stages 1 and 2 were excluded. The results show that the YOLOv8 model outperforms the Sequential CNN in accuracy and overall performance.
